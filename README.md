## Overview

This is simple UCI chess engine, that describes chess rules and can play chess randomly.
Feel free to test, analyze and use it for your own purposes.
The project is still under development, so I beg you pardon for the code is not "clean" enough and may contain mistakes.
Feel free to contact me to discuss the subject !

## UCI protocol

The Universal Chess Interface (UCI) is an open communication protocol that enables chess engines to communicate with user interfaces.
Gee engine implements major commands, but many of them are still not supported. 
Anyway you can try GUI, that supports UCI, and try this engine on it. ( for example http://www.playwitharena.de/ )

## Build and Install

This project is cmake-based, it should work with standard cmake environment.
My environment is VSCode & mingw.
Make a standard setup for C++ and run VSCode.
Compile executable and load it into GUI.
